Podcast Manager app in Java to practise with Databases and XML

We must manage a Java app for podcast, with autor  and genre "genero". This podcast must be audio or video, a podcast can have multiple genres.

We have a database to work with and we must create an Object Oriented Architecture. We need efficience in connections with DB.

To develop:

1. Add new podcast with all info according to type, asking to user it's author
2. Add new genre
3. Refresh genres in a podcast
4. Delete a podcast
5. View all stored podcast in database
6. View an specific podcast and have option to generate an XML info of the selected podcast

Database notes:
- It's written in spanish as the application.
- On the podcast table there's only a "tipo" field. 0 if it's audio and "calidad".
- If it's 1 it's video and has the field "formato_video".
