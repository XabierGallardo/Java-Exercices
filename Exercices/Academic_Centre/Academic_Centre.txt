We want to implement different functionalities of an Academic Centre.
There will be different students and subjects, they'll have to register on a simple menu.
For students, record number and name. For subjects code, number and credits (Subjects will have students and a student can have multiple subjects)
We'll need to register qualifications from students for every subject.

On AcademicCentre.java

#boolean createStudent(String record, String name)
Create and add student. Cannot exists two students with same record, will return false if student couldn't be registered and true if it does

#boolean createSubject(String code, String number, String credits)
Create and add subject. Cannot exits two subjects with same code, will return false if subject couldn't be registered and true if it does

#boolean register(String record, String code)
Will register student onto subject's code, will return false if student cannot be found and/or if it was already assigned to it

#void printStudent(String record)
Will print on scren information of student

#void printStudents()
Will print all registered students on the center

#boolean addQualification(String record, String code, String qualification)
Assign a qualification to an student as it appears on subject's code, will return false if the student is not registered on that subject

#void comparateStudent (String record1, String record2)
Will print which student has bigger qualifications
