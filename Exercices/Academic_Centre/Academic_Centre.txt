We want to implement different functionalities of an Academic Centre.
There will be different students and subjects, they'll have to register on a simple menu.
For students, record number and name. For subjects code, number and credits (Subjects will have students and a student can have multiple subjects)
We'll need to register qualifications from students for every subject.

On AcademicCentre.java

boolean createStudent(String record, String name)

boolean createSubject(String code, String number, String credits)

boolean register(String record, String code)

void printStudent(String record)

void printStudents()

boolean addQualification(String record, String code, String qualification)

void comparateStudent (String record1, String record2)
